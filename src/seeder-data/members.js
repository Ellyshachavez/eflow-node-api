    description:
      "Colin is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Davis working under the guidance of Drs. Pasternack, Sandoval, and Lane. His research focuses on statistical classification of river forms and development of archetypical river morphologies to inform ecological flow management. Colin earned his PhD at the University of New Mexico where he studied flood wave hydrodynamics and hydrologic lateral surface connectivity between river channels and floodplains. Colin's research interests focus on interdisciplinary river science for improved ecological function of rivers and floodplains.",

      'Hervé is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Davis working with Dr. Lane and Dr. Samuel Sandoval (UC Davis) to derive a hydro-geomorphic stream classification for multiple hydrologic basins in California. He is using data mining and machine learning techniques to understand landscape and near-stream controls on channel geomorphic settings. Hervé completed his PhD in the Institut des Sciences de la Terre in France on present-day erosion processes in a glaciated catchment in the Mont-Blanc massif. Before coming to UC Davis, Hervé joined the hydrology and glaciology laboratory Institut des Géosciences de l’Environnement in France to discriminate suspended sediment origin from in-situ settling behaviour with optical methods.',

      'Greg Pasternack is a professor with two decades of interdisciplinary scientific and engineering training and experience, yielding expertise in ecogeomorphology, ecohydraulics, sediment processes, and watershed hydrology.  He leads collaborative efforts that help society manage and restore hydrogeomorphic processes in support of enhanced ecosystem functioning at local to watershed scales.  This requires a combination of basic physical and ecological science to understand how the naturally complex landscape works and then technology transfer to enable practitioners, regulators, and stakeholders to solve problems.',
